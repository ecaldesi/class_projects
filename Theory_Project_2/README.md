# Finite Automata

- dfa-international.py: program that, when given one file that represents a set of possibly many input strings and another that represents a rule set for a deterministic finite automaton (DFA), computes the states that the DFA transitions through for each input string.
- nfa-international.py: program that takes the rule set for a NFA and converts it into a rule set for an equivalent DFA.
