# K- Tape Turing Machine
By Elisabetta Caldesi

Files
------
tm-international.py: program that, when given one file that represents a descsription of a TM, will execute that program against a variety of problems found in a second file representing initial tape values. It also demonstrates the operation of a TM in two ways: first as a language recognizer and second as a computation that leaves behind on its tapes the result of a computation.

Here's the link to the full description of the assignment:
